	<h1>Ajiaco <span style="font-size: 16px;">(Colombian Chicken Soup)</span></h1>
	<section>
<p class="intro">This hearty soup is a specialty of the mountainous region around Bogot&aacute;, and one of Colombia's most famous dishes. Aji is traditionally made with chiles that haven&rsquo;t been seeded, but you&rsquo;ll probably find it plenty spicy without the seeds. Leftover aji is delicious on roasted or grilled meats.</p></section>

<h2>Directions <span class="hint">(Click on each step once you're done!)</span></h2>
<h3>Make the soup:</h3>
<p class="single_dir"> + Put the chicken in a large (at least 8-quart) stockpot and add 8 cups water. Bring to a boil over high heat and then reduce the heat to a vigorous simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes, frequently skimming off the foam that floats to the surface.</p>

<p class="single_dir">+ Add all the vegetables, the garlic, the cilantro, and the bouillon cubes to the pot, along with the salt and pepper. Stir a few times to distribute the vegetables and submerge as many of the solids as possible. When the broth returns to a gentle boil, partially cover the pot and simmer, stirring once or twice, for 1-1/2 hours. Taste for salt and add more if needed.</p>

<p class="single_dir">+ Using tongs or a slotted spoon, pick out the chicken pieces and put them on a large plate. Stir the soup with a large spoon, breaking up some of the potatoes to thicken the soup slightly. Keep hot if serving soon or let cool and refrigerate.</p>

<p class="single_dir">+ When the chicken is cool enough to handle, pull the meat off the bones and shred it by hand. Discard the bones and tendons, and put the shredded chicken in a serving bowl.</p>
